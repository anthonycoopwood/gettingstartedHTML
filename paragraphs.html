              <p> LeBron James is the best player in the world.Simply best no one can stop him. </p>
               <p> Some people say LeBron James is coming for Micheal Jordans thrown.However some says he already took it. </p>
                <p>He now surpassed Jordan is the record books. Besides in championship wins.</p>
                 <p> I feel James has already passed Jordan and now has the tittle of "The GOAT." What do you think? </p>
